## Real life examples in which cases this algorithm could be applied
1.Data Organization: 
<br>Managing and organizing data in a way that minimizes the number of moves or operations, similar to how disks are moved in the algorithm. <br>
<br>
2.Recursive Problem Solving: <br>Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks, which is a common approach in software development and project management. <br>
<br>
3.Resource Allocation:<br> Efficiently allocating resources in stages, ensuring that each step is completed before moving on to the next, much like moving disks in the correct order.<br>
<br>

## Rules
    Base Case: If there’s only one disk, simply move it from the source rod to the destination rod.

    Recursive Case:
        Move the top ( n-1 ) disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod. This step uses the destination rod as a temporary holding area.
        Move the nth (largest) disk from the source rod to the destination rod.
        Move the ( n-1 ) disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod, using the source rod as a temporary holding area.

This process is repeated recursively until all disks are moved to the destination rod. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown for clarity:

    Move ( n-1 ) disks from Source to Auxiliary (using Destination as auxiliary).
    Move the nth disk from Source to Destination.
    Move ( n-1 ) disks from Auxiliary to Destination (using Source as auxiliary).
